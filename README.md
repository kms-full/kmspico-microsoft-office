# KMS Pico for Microsoft Office—Why Is It Popular & Where to Download It?

KMS Pico can be used to activate any Microsoft Office product such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint without a license key. The version must be from 2010 to 2021. KMS Pico is a very popular tool that is commonly used to activate these Office products free of cost using the Key Management Service trick. Today, we’re going to talk about this KMS Pico Office activator, its popularity, and how to download and install it in 2024 safely.

# What is the KMS Activator Office?

The KMS Activator Office is a free utility that tricks Microsoft Office into thinking that it’s been activated legitimately using a local Key Management Service server. This utility mimics the process of large organizations managing bulk activations across their Windows devices. It can activate any Office product version from 2010 to 2021 on any operator system from Windows 7 and 8 to 10 and 11.
You can activate either Home or Professional versions of the product and it works 100% offline, so you don’t connect to Microsoft’s servers when doing the activation process.

# Why is KMS Pico Popular for Microsoft Office Activation?

The KMS Pico Office Activator is very popular. There are several key reasons here, so let’s talk about them a little bit:

    1. The Office KMS Pico activation method is 100% free. You can download any trial for any Office version, then use this tool to get them activated for free to use all of their capabilities.
    2. You can activate any edition across versions from the older Office 2010 to the new Office 2021. After Office 2021, Microsoft switched to Microsoft 365 as a subscription-based service, which introduced problems in the KMS activation method.
    3. The activation process is 100% automatic, very user-friendly, and safe.
    4. The Office KMS Activator offers a long-term, auto-renewing solution. As long as you don’t uninstall the Office products or format your PC, you’re going to have the products activated.

  # Download & Install KMS Pico for Office Activation Safely in 2024

  It’s super important to download KMS activator only from trusted sources. A lot of bad actors bundle KMS Pico utilities with additional malware that can be dangerous for your PC. We highly recommend sticking to the official website of the original creator behind the tool—Team Daz. The website is kmspi.co and it allows you to download the utility in a single click.
Follow these steps:

    1. Close any Office apps that you have open.
    2. (Optional) Exclude a folder where you will download the file within your antivirus software.
    3. (Optional) Turn off your internet access. You can disable the ethernet or turn off WiFi.
    4. Turn off the antivirus protections temporarily.
    5. Download the file and extract it.
    6. Run the Office KMS Activator installer as Admin (right-click > Run as Administrator) and follow the on-screen instructions.
    7. Open any Office app and check its activation status.
    8. Turn on antivirus protections.
    
The activation can sometimes fail or the file might get removed. Both these issues happen because of the antivirus. That’s why it’s very important to turn off all types of protections and as an additional precaution, to set an exclusion for the folder where you’ll be downloading the utility, where you’ll be unzipping it, and where you’ll be installing it.

# In Conclusion

KMS Pico is a fast and reliable tool to activate Office products in one go. It can also renew itself continually, meaning you don’t have to worry about reactivating the products on your system. As long as you download KMS Pico from our recommended source and install it using the proper steps, you’ll be good to go. It’s perfectly safe and countless people use it daily to activate their Microsoft Office products. The best part? It can also activate any Windows version and edition as well! So, if your Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Home is not activated, you can use the very same software, go through the instructions for activating the OS, and have an activated Windows installation in no time.
Also, it’s highly recommended that you download the portable version of KMS Pico for Office. A portable version can help you minimize any installation risk. You can use it to activate your Office products from a USB drive, which helps you avoid installing the utility on your PC. This is particularly useful if you are downloading from a third-party source that’s not the original creator’s website or GitHub repository. These can have malware that will stay isolated if you use a portable installation method of KMS Pico.
